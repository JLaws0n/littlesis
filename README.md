About LittleSis
===============

[LittleSis](http://littlesis.org) is a free database of who-knows-who at the heights of business and government. LittleSis is a project of [Public Accountability Initiative](http://public-accountability.org), a non-profit public interest research organization investigating power and corruption at the heights of business and government. 

LittleSis is open source software licensed under the [GNU Public License](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).

Installation
============

The recommended and non-agonizing way to install LittleSis is either with [Docker](https://github.com/littlesis-org/littlesis/wiki/Install-with-Docker) or [docker-osx-dev](https://github.com/littlesis-org/littlesis/wiki/Install-with-Docker-via-docker-osx-dev) (for Mac Users).


Install Notes (OUTDATED AND AGONIZING)
=====================================

LittleSis requires PHP 5.2.3+ with cURL, GD, PDO and Memcache extensions. The application requires that version 1.1.7 (through 1.1.9) of the [Symfony framework](http://symfony-project.org) and [Sphinx](http://sphinxsearch.com) are installed on the server.


### Download LittleSis on gitHub

First you must download the source code from the LittleSis repository on gitHub. You must have [Git](http://git-scm.com/) installed. Email admin@littlesis.org if you'd like to contribute to the LittleSis code.

Create a directory in your web root and perform the checkout:

    mkdir /var/www/littlesis
    cd /var/www/littlesis
    git clone git://github.com/littlesis-org/littlesis.git .

Git will download the source code (roughly 42 MB) to your machine.


### Create and Load Databases

Create two databases, one for the application and one for raw parsed & scraped data, for example:

    mysql> CREATE DATABASE littlesis DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 DEFAULT COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
    mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON littlesis.* TO 'littlesis'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'fakepassword';
    mysql> CREATE DATABASE littlesis_raw DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 DEFAULT COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
    mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON littlesis_raw.* TO 'littlesis'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'fakepassword';

Edit `config/databases.yml.dist`, enter the connection parameters for the two databases you created, and save as `config/databases.yml`:

    all:
      raw:
        class:      sfDoctrineDatabase
        param:
          dsn:      mysql://littlesis:fakepassword@localhost/littlesis_raw
    
      main:
        class:      sfDoctrineDatabase
        param:
          dsn:      mysql://littlesis:fakepassword@localhost/littlesis


### LittleSis Configuration

Edit `config/ProjectConfiguration.class.php.dist`, fill in the path to the symfony 1.1 libraries, and save as `config/ProjectConfiguration.class.php`:

    <?php
    
    require_once '/usr/share/php/symfony11/lib/autoload/sfCoreAutoload.class.php';

Edit `web/.htaccess.dist`, enter the web path to your index.php front controller (usually `/index.php` or `/littlesis/index.php`, and save as `web/.htaccess`:

      # no, so we redirect to our front web controller
      RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /littlesis/index.php [QSA,L]
    </IfModule>

To enable the API, API account registration and API documentation:
 * Edit `apps/api/config/app.yml.dist`, enter the ReCAPTCHA keys and admin API key, and save as `apps/api/config/app.yml`.
 * Edit `apps/api/config/settings.yml.dist`, enter a CRSF token secret string, and save as `apps/api/config/settings.yml`.

To enable the LittleSis frontend, user account registration, and map pages: 
 * Edit `apps/frontend/config/app.yml.dist`, enter the Google Maps and ReCAPTCHA keys, and save as `apps/frontend/config/app.yml`. 
 * Edit `apps/frontend/config/settings.yml.dist`, enter a CRSF token secret string, and save as `apps/frontend/config/settings.yml`. 
 * There are other keys you may need to set if you want to use some of the scrapers...

Now you need to make the cache directory recursively writable, and create a log directory with an empty log file. This can be done with a symfony command:

    cd /var/www/littlesis
    symfony fix-perms


### Configure Apache

Now you need to create Apache aliases pointing the `/littlesis` and `/littlesis/sf` URL paths to the proper locations on your machine. This can be tricky if you haven't created Apache aliases before. An example is below.

    Alias /littlesis/sf /usr/share/php/symfony11/data/web/sf/
    <Directory "/usr/share/php/symfony11/data/web/sf/">
      Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks
      AllowOverride All
      Allow from All
    </Directory>

    Alias /littlesis/ "/var/www/littlesis/web/"
    <Directory "/var/www/littlesis/web/">
        Options Indexes Multiviews FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride All
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    </Directory>

Restart Apache.


### Load Initial Data

If you have a database dump, import it: 

    mysql -u littlesis -p littlesis < some_dump.sql

Otherwise, you need to create the necessary database tables and import data from a fixtures file:

    symfony doctrine:build-sql frontend
    symfony doctrine:insert-sql frontend
    symfony doctrine:data-load frontend

Now clear the cache and you're good to go!

    symfony cc

Visit `http://localhost/littlesis/` to load the site. You can access the dev environment at `http://localhost/littlesis/frontend_dev.php/`.

If you ever get a permissions error while attempting to clear the cache, try this first:

    sudo symfony fix-perms

You can check that LittleSis is up and running by visiting http://localhost/littlesis/frontend_dev.php (or whatever web path you've parked your LittleSis installation at) in your web browser. You should see a welcome screen. By default LittleSis comes with three pre-existing user accounts, "System", "Bot", and "Admin", which are used by the software in various situations. Now that you have the application running, you can login to LittleSis as any of them in order to gain access to the backend tools:

 * **System** [username: system@example.org, password: system]
 * **Bot** [username: bot@example.org, password: bot1]
 * **Admin** [username: admin@example.org, password: admin]


### Misc

Create tmp directory:

    mkdir tmp
    chmod -R 777 tmp

Create image directories:

    mkdir web/images/small
    chmod 777 web/images/small
    mkdir web/images/profile
    chmod 777 web/images/profile
    mkdir web/images/large
    chmod 777 web/images/large
    mkdir web/images/square
    chmod 777 web/images/square

Create cookies file:

    mkdir -p data/sfWebBrowserPlugin/sfCurlAdapter
    touch data/sfWebBrowserPlugin/sfCurlAdapter/cookies.txt


### Setup Search

However, at this point search on LittleSis will not work. For this you will need to install and configure [Sphinx](http://www.sphinxsearch.com/).

First, download and compile the latest stable version of Sphinx from its website (version 2.0.6 as of now). Make sure to compile with MySQL support.

Edit `config/sphinx.conf.dist` in the LittleSis application, replacing `[username]`, `[password]` and other parts in [] brackets with your local settings, and save the modified file as `config/sphinx.conf`.

Create writable log files at the locations you specified in sphinx.conf (for example, `/var/log/searchd/searchd.pid`, etc):

    cd /var/www/littlesis/log
    mkdir searchd
    cd searchd
    touch searchd.log
    touch query.log
    touch searchd.pid
    chmod a+w *

Generate indexes:

    indexer --config config/sphinx.conf --all

Start searchd:

    searchd --config config/sphinx.conf

Create the following cron jobs to update the Sphinx index so that edits are reflected in the search (within a minute):

    0 0 * * * indexer --config [path/to/littlesis]/config/sphinx.conf entities notes --rotate
    * * * * * indexer --config [path/to/littlesis]/config/sphinx.conf entities-delta notes-delta --rotate

The "entities" and "notes" index updates only at midnight, whereas the "delta" indexes update every minute. This is to minimize index-rebuilding time while keeping the index constantly fresh. For further explanation of this indexing strategy, see the [Live index updates](http://www.sphinxsearch.com/docs/manual-0.9.8.html#live-updates) section of the Sphinx documentation.

Clear the Symfony cache and search on the site should now work!

    symfony cc
    

### Other Cron Jobs

You'll also need to install these cron jobs to enable LittleSis-triggered emails and keep the link table synced with the relationship table:

    */10 * * * * [path/to/littlesis]/symfony email:send-scheduled >>/home/lilsis/www/log/send-scheduled-emails.log
    45 * * * * [path/to/littlesis]/symfony links:update --limit=500 >>/dev/null 2>&1
