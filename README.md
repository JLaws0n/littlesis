Installation & Development
============

We are currently moving all our code from symfony (this repo) to Rails. This is about 70% complete. All current development in LittleSis happens in this repository: [github.com/skomputer/lilsis](https://github.com/skomputer/lilsis)

Currently, this app must be run in tandem with the Rails app. The recommended and non-agonizing way to install littlesis is via docker.[See here](https://github.com/aepyornis/littlesis-docker) for docker instructions.
